- EC Lib

This wraps Blizzard driverlib and implements the EC chip interface defined
by Google. See below diagram for architecture.

Build Options
=============

NOTE: see include/config.h for the current list.  The information
below will be moved there over time.

- CONFIG_WATCHDOG_HELP

	Try to detect a watchdog that is about to fire, and print a trace.
	This is needed on STM32, where the independent watchdog has no early
	warning feature and the windowed watchdog has a very short period.

- CONFIG_AC_POWER_STATUS

	Monitor the state of the AC power input and drive out a GPIO to
	the AP indicating this state. The GPIO will be driven low when
	AC power is not connected, and high when it is connected. This
	uses GPIO_AC_STATUS for this purpose.

- CONFIG_KEYBOARD_TEST

	Turn on keyboard testing functionality. This enables a message which
	received a list of keyscan events from the AP and processes them.
	This will cause keypresses to appear on the AP through the same
	mechanism as a normal keyboard press.
