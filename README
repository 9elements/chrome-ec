- EC Lib

This wraps Blizzard driverlib and implements the EC chip interface defined
by Google. See below diagram for architecture.

Build Options
=============

- CONFIG_WATCHDOG_HELP

	Try to detect a watchdog that is about to fire, and print a trace.
	This is needed on STM32, where the independent watchdog has no early
	warning feature and the windowed watchdog has a very short period.

- CONFIG_PANIC_HELP

	Report extra information about a panic, such as the fault address,
	here shown as bfar. This shows the reason for the fault and may help
	to determine the cause.

	=== EXCEPTION: 03 ====== xPSR: 01000000 ===========

	mmfs = 00008200, shcsr = 00000000, hfsr = 40000000, dfsr = 00000008

- CONFIG_ASSERT_HELP

	Report assertion failures in a vebose manner to aid debugging. When
	enabled an ASSERT() which fails will produce message in the form:

		ASSERTION FAILURE '<expr>' in function() at file:line

- CONFIG_CONFIGURE_BOARD_LATE

	Define this to call configure_board_late() after initial system init
	is complete (and after GPIOs are set up).

- CONFIG_AC_POWER_STATUS

	Monitor the state of the AC power input and drive out a GPIO to
	the AP indicating this state. The GPIO will be driven low when
	AC power is not connected, and high when it is connected. This
	uses GPIO_AC_STATUS for this purpose.
